# Welcome to Billy Grace

This is our organization's github account.


## Git Strategy

Our strategy is to branch from master per ticket we have. This way each branch will be relatelively small. The format we use is:  
*TicketID-name-of-ticket*

For example we can create a branch at the start of the day to be merged later on with the name:
```bash
BG1234-add-linear-graph
```

This way other team members can easily identify what is being build in the branch by either the ticket ID itself or the name used to identify it.  

Then you can submit your PR to be reviewed by your other team mate, which could be subject to change based on the given feedback.  

If this then has been approved, the PR can be merged and will be included in our next release.
